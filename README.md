# Structure and code conventions

The source code is located in the *src* folder.

For each chapter, there is a subfolder here with the name chapter_*number* (e.g. chapter_01, chapter_02, chapter_03, etc.)
Some chapters are split in multiple projects, one for each topic. For instance:

* chapter_01\chapter_01 - Hello World program
* chapter_02\chapter_02 - Data types, variables, constants, arrays, nullables, type conversions, operators
* chapter_08\chapter_08_01 - Delegates and Events
* chapter_08\chapter_08_02 - Anonymous methods
* chapter_08\chapter_08_03 - Tuples
* chapter_08\chapter_08_04 - Pattern matching
* chapter_08\chapter_08_05 - Regular expressions
* chapter_08\chapter_08_06 - Extension methods

The solution file *learning_charp8.sln* contains all these projects together. The projects are .NET Core console apps and target .NET Core 3.1.
